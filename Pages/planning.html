  <h1>Planning Tips</h1>
  <p>Any good adventure needs a good plan, and cold weather camping is no different! When planning for a cold weather camp-out, keep the following topics in mind:</p>
  <h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>Activities are a great way to enjoy yourself and forget about the cold. You could go on a day hike around the campgrounds, cross country ski, or have a massive snowball fight with your friends! Whatever it is, make sure your camping group is aware of the planned activity and that you bring any extra equipment needed to make is successful.</p>
  <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Food is (obviously) essential to any camping trip. Planning out meals ahead of time will ensure that meal time is stress free and delicious! Start by answering the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many days are we camping?</li>
      <li>How many people are coming?</li>
      <li>Are there any dietary concerns?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After these questions have been answered, you should plan three meals for each day you are camping. It is also a good idea to make a grocery list. An example meal plan might look something like this:</p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Day</th>
        <th>Breakfast</th>
        <th>Lunch</th>
        <th>Dinner</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Day 1</td>
        <td>Eggs and Bacon</td>
        <td>Sandwiches</td>
        <td>Chili</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Day 2</td>
        <td>Yogurt</td>
        <td>Tacos</td>
        <td>Spaghetti</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
